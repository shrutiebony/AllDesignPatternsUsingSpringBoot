Hi, all this is a group of different projects, each one implementing one design pattern of microservices.
These include: 
1) API Gatewaye
2) Zipkin server
3) Eureka registry

MaintenanceOptions and DDD service are 2 main microservices that are being used for these design patterns.
These are spring Boot projects.
